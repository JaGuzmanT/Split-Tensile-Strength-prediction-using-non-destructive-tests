# Split-Tensile-Strength-prediction-using-non-destructive-tests
## Description of the repository

This repository contains 1 folder named model with 2 notebooks, 1.- Data preprocessing and 2. DNN model.

Features: Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), Electrical resistivity (Er), Resonance frequency (Rf), and Compressive strength (Cs).

Target: Split Tensile Strength

Type of problem: Supervised and Regression problem

Regressor: Deep Neural Network, DNN for short.

##Note: Wheter you need to prove your own dataset, you just need to change the name of the file.csv in the first notebook according to the name of your file.
